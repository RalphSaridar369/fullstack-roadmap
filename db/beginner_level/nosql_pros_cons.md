# 🗄️ NoSQL Databases

NoSQL databases include **Key–Value, Document, Column-Based, and Graph** databases.  
They are designed for **flexible, scalable, and high-performance data storage**.  

---

## ✅ Pros
- **Flexible schemas** (easy to adapt to new data)  
- **Horizontally scalable** (handle huge datasets)  
- **High performance** for specific workloads  
- Can store **unstructured or semi-structured data**  
- Some types optimized for **relationships or analytics**  

---

## ❌ Cons
- **Less standardized** than SQL (query languages vary)  
- Some lack **full ACID transactions** (eventual consistency)  
- Data integrity must often be handled at the application level  
- Can be **less mature** for complex analytics
